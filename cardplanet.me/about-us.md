# About CardPlanet

## üìñ Our Story

Founded in 2024, CardPlanet emerged from a simple observation: content creators spend countless hours struggling with design tools that weren't built for their specific needs. Traditional design platforms are either too complex for beginners or too generic for specialized content like knowledge cards.
